# BikeSharing
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if investing in the BikeSharing business would be a good investment. Using Tableau and Panda's I was able to create a story using data from Manhattan bikeshare to visually demonstrate the number or rides and peak times for usage.
  
## Results
The fist Dashboard bellow gives you a good idea of the top starting and stopping locations to understand the duration of each ride. The third chart shows you the average ride duration for each riders birth year which tells you to target ages 18- 50. The last chart gives you information as to how much each bike has been ridden to help determine when repairs should happen.
